# forkinfo

Github will show you a list of forks for any repository via its Insights page, but to find out any other
useful information such as when the fork was last updated, how many commits differ etc., you're
forced to open each and every fork in a new tab... Often to find that most haven't changed at all!

Forkinfo aims to fix that by providing basic information about all forks with one simple command.
